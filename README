**VoxelCube**

WORK IN PROGRESS
Simple voxel game using chunked procedural map rendering.

Done:
- Use octrees to store and render blocks
- Cull inner faces to save memory

Todo:
- Create chunk manager (loader and deloader)
- Use chunk manager to employ level of detail rendering
- change the map octree into a DAG for octree compression
